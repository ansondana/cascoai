I want to integrate a client portal feature into my existing Lovable site. I have the complete portal code in this GitHub repository:

**Repository**: https://github.com/ansondana/cascoai
**Folder**: `/portal` (contains the Next.js app)

## What I Need:

I want to add a portal section accessible at `/portal` and sub-routes like:
- `/portal` - Dashboard
- `/portal/test` - Test Agent
- `/portal/analytics` - Analytics
- `/portal/knowledge` - Knowledge Bank
- `/portal/feedback` - Feedback
- `/portal/admin` - Admin Panel

## Features Needed:

1. **Dashboard** - Shows agent overview, quick action cards, active agents list
2. **Analytics** - Charts showing call metrics, filtering by date/agent
3. **Test Agent** - Interface to test voice agents with real or simulated calls
4. **Knowledge Bank** - Editor to manage agent knowledge base with version control
5. **Feedback** - Form to submit bugs, improvements, or feedback
6. **Admin Panel** - Internal admin features (if admin role)

## Requirements:

- **Authentication**: Uses Auth0 (already configured in my project)
- **Styling**: Should match my existing site design/style
- **API Client**: Needs to connect to backend API at `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- **Dependencies**: Already installed in my project or can be added

## Can You Help:

1. Access the GitHub repo and review the portal folder structure?
2. Create the necessary routes and components in my existing Lovable project?
3. Integrate the portal seamlessly with my existing site design?
4. Set up the Auth0 authentication flow for portal pages?
5. Create the API client to connect to my backend?

The portal should:
- Require Auth0 login to access
- Show a clean dashboard with navigation
- Integrate with existing Auth0 configuration
- Use the same design system/styling as my site

Let me know what you can access from the repo and how you'd like to proceed with the integration.

## Alternative Shorter Version:

If the above is too long, use this:

```
I need to integrate a client portal from this GitHub repo into my site:
https://github.com/ansondana/cascoai (portal folder)

Add it at /portal route with dashboard, analytics, testing, knowledge management, 
and feedback features. Use Auth0 for auth (already configured). Match my existing 
site design. Can you access the repo and help integrate it?
```
